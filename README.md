# Insurance Data Analysis using Power BI

## 🧩Problem Statement
Insurance companies deal with large volumes of policy, premium, and claim data, but turning this data into meaningful insights is often challenging. Without a clear analytical view, it becomes difficult to understand which policy types generate the most revenue, how claims are distributed across customer segments, and where potential risk or inefficiencies exist in the claims process.

This project aims to analyze insurance data stored in a MySQL database and present it through a structured, multi-page Power BI report. The goal is to provide a clear overview of premium collection, coverage exposure, claim status, and customer demographics, enabling better visibility into claim behavior, policy performance, and operational decision-making.

## 📋Objectives
* Provide an overall view of key insurance metrics such as total premium amount, coverage amount, and claim amount to understand the scale of business operations.

* Analyze the distribution of insurance claims across different claim statuses (settled, rejected, pending) to assess claims processing effectiveness.

* Compare premium contributions across policy types (Travel, Health, Auto, Life, Home) to identify the most revenue-generating insurance products.

+ Examine claim amounts across age groups to understand how claim behavior varies among different customer segments.

* Evaluate the proportion of active and inactive policies to identify potential retention risks and portfolio health.

🔄 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Requirement Understanding & Scope Definition

* Reviewed the dataset and business context to understand the analytical objectives.

* Identified key metrics, dimensions, and insights required for the report.

* Defined the structure of the report, including the number of pages and the focus of each page.


2️⃣ Data Source Setup & Connectivity

* Connected Power BI to the required data source such as MySQL depending on the project.

* Verified successful data ingestion and data refresh configuration.

3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Opened the data in Power Query Editor for transformation.

* Checked column profiling (quality, distribution, and profile) to understand data completeness and accuracy.

* Corrected data types, handled errors if present, and validated that the dataset was ready for analysis.

4️⃣ Report Design & Visual Development

* Designed a multi-page Power BI report, with each page addressing a specific analytical theme.

* Selected appropriate visuals (bar charts, line charts, donut charts, matrices, decomposition trees) based on the nature of the data.

* Applied slicers and filters to enable interactive exploration.

5️⃣ Insight Validation & Refinement

* Cross checked insights across multiple visuals to ensure consistency and accuracy.

* Refined visuals and calculations where required to align with data behavior.

* Ensured that insights were fully supported by the underlying data.

## 💡 Key Insights

* Travel and Health insurance policies generate the highest premium amounts, making them the most significant contributors to overall revenue.

* A considerable portion of claims remains either pending or rejected, indicating potential inefficiencies or stricter evaluation within the claims process.

* Middle-aged and adult customers account for the highest claim amounts, suggesting higher insurance utilization within these age groups.

* Inactive policies form a noticeable share of the portfolio, highlighting opportunities for customer re-engagement and retention strategies.

* Premium and claim amounts vary significantly by policy type, showing that risk exposure is not evenly distributed across insurance products.
